## Who Am I?
Hey, I’m Nirmal, a proactive professional with a positive attitude and experience in implementing innovative solutions and leveraging agile methodologies. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Information Management and working towards building a career as a Data Analyst/Data Engineer. I have created dashboards using tools like Tableau and Power BI, which help visualize and analyze data effectively. These tools allow me to present data insights clearly and interactively, making it easier to support decision-making processes. I aim to continue developing my data analysis and visualization skills to help businesses make data-driven decisions.
When I'm not immersed in coding, software development, or data analysis, I enjoy spending time in the gym, adventure, music, art and photography.
